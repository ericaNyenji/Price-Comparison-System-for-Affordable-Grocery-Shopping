➝ The system is a grocery shopping app designed to help users search for cheapest grocery items and view a comparison of prices across multiple supermarkets in a country. 

➝ It has two separate dashboards one for supermarket owners the other for customers.

➝ It’s uses Node.js, Express, SQL for the backend and React for the front end. It also uses socket. io integration for real time price updates(user doesn’t have to keep refreshing to receive real time updates). 

➝ It has a map (Leaflet) where supermarket owners click to show the location of their supermarkets when they are registering their supermarkets to the system. 

➝ It can be extended to cover other countries not just Kenya(only problem is not enough storage yet). At the moment I have data of Kenya and Hungary.

➝ Users can also crowd source for Price Updates(maybe if they notice that the price on a product is wrong) hence contributing to system’s accuracy. 

➝ Users can also leave reviews for products fostering a community driven platform. 

➝ Supermarkets owners can put products on deal
